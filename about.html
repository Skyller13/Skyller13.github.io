<h2>About</h2>

I am a programmer who is eager to overcome new challenges on a daily basis.<br>
I love working on side projects and I'm thrilled about engine, tools and gameplay
programming.<br>As a part of my routine I love to work on a side project that I hope to release
someday.<br>In the meanwhile, I love to hit the gym and to do some calisthenics from time to time.<br>
Apart from that, I'm learning hip hop and I am a volunteer in a choir.<br>
I also love video games, animals and musics.
