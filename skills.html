## Skills

<p>I’m a developer with experience across a variety of tools and platforms,<br> 
from game engines like Unity and Unreal to low-level graphics programming with Vulkan and OpenGL.<br>
I’m comfortable with languages like C++, C#, and Lua, and I have a good understanding of computer vision through OpenCV.<br>
Whether it's creating custom UIs with ImGui or managing projects using GitHub, Perforce, Jira or even Trello,<br>
I focus on delivering practical and efficient solutions for every challenge that comes my way.</p>
